* FILE SETUP + DESCRIPTION
lib
    core
       config.py - set up width, height, path of images, epoch, batch size
     dataset
        input_img - folder containing member headshots from the spring 2021 photoshoot. Images must be named #_memberName.jpg 
        dataset.py - creates a dataset class
    model
        model.py - creates a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) class
output
    losses.png - graph showing how much the model changes after each epoch
predict.py - where we use the model. Choose an image path on line 16 to feed into the model. The model will return the predicted person
train.py - used to train the model (no need to retrain unless adjusting training images, epoch, or batch size)

* VOCAB
Batch - The number of images simultaneously fed into the model for training
Epoch - The number of times each batch is fed into the model for training

* GENERAL PROCESS
1. Laying the groundwork: We setup config.py, dataset.py, and model.py and upload photos to input_img. Change paths in config.py to align with local directories
2. Train the model using train.py
3. Use the model using predict.py
